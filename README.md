# Dodge it

[Dodge It](https://dodge-it.vercel.app) is a game that simulates the situation when you are driving a car on the road and you want to get home.

## Description

On the way home may appear people as well as obstacles (road cracks) that you must **DODGE**.

Cracks will stay in the place they appear but that is not the case for people. These people are going to move once they are visible.

## Randomness

Positions will randomly be set for:

- Car - you will drive it.
- Home - it is the goal of the game.
- People and road cracks.

## Random number algorithms

[Dodge It](dodge-it.vercel.app) uses the [Linear Congruential Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) for determine the next obstacle to render as well as the people movement.

## How to use:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Then run:

### `npm run dev`

> All you need to do is to dodge it!
